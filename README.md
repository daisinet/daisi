## Daisi Full Solution
This is one repo to rule them all. Just makes it easier to work on the whole project with them all in one place.

### To Get Started
You will need to clone all of the repos for Hosts, Orcs, Manager, and SDK into the same folder.

Should be something like this:

```
cd c:\repos\daisinet
git clone https://github.com/daisinet/daisi-sdk-dotnet.git daisi-sdk-dotnet
git clone https://github.com/daisinet/daisi-tools-dotnet.git daisi-tools-dotnet
git clone https://github.com/daisinet/daisi-hosts-dotnet.git daisi-hosts-dotnet
git clone https://github.com/daisinet/daisi-manager-dotnet.git daisi-manager-dotnet
git clone https://github.com/daisinet/daisi-orc-dotnet.git daisi-orc-dotnet

```
